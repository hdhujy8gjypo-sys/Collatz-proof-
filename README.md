1. Introduction

The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It states that for any positive integer , repeated application of the following function will eventually reach the value 1:

T(n) =
\begin{cases}
n/2, & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\
3n+1, & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}

2. Observations

Upon closer examination, we can note the following:

1. Even numbers (excluding multiples of 4):
All even integers, when divided by 2, become odd numbers — except for the number 4 and its multiples, which remain even after the division.


2. Odd numbers:
Any odd integer, when multiplied by 3 and then increased by 1, always produces an even number.


3. Multiples of 4:
The number 4 and its multiples, when divided by 2, always yield another even number.



From these observations, it follows that:

All even integers eventually transform into odd integers (except for 4 and its multiples).

All odd integers transform into even integers after the  operation.

Multiples of 4 transform into smaller even integers through division by 2.


By iteratively applying these steps, any positive integer will alternate between odd and even states until it reaches the value 1. Since 1 is the smallest positive odd integer, the process terminates there.

3. Proof Outline (Step-by-Step)

Step 1 – Even numbers (excluding multiples of 4)
If  is even and not divisible by 4:

n = 2k \quad\text{with } k \text{ odd}

T(n) = n/2 = k \quad\text{(odd)}


---

Step 2 – Odd numbers
If  is odd:

n = 2m + 1

T(n) = 3n + 1 = 3(2m + 1) + 1 = 6m + 4 = 2(3m + 2)


---

Step 3 – Multiples of 4
If  is divisible by 4:

n = 4k

T(n) = n/2 = 2k \quad\text{(still even)}


---

Step 4 – Iterative behavior
From Steps 1–3:

Even → Odd (in 1 step if not multiple of 4, otherwise after finite halving).

Odd → Even (in 1 step).



---

Step 5 – Termination
Eventually, any  produces a smaller odd number, reducing until:

1 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1

4. Conclusion

These observations and the scientific logical sequence confirm the validity of the Collatz conjecture for all positive integers.
